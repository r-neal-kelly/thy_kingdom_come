1: ¶ And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2: Behold, I have called by name Beseleel the son of Urias the son of Or, of the tribe of Juda.
3: And I have filled him [with] a divine spirit of wisdom, and understanding, and knowledge, to invent in every work,
4: and to frame works, to labour in gold, and silver, and brass, and blue, and purple, and spun scarlet,
5: and works in stone, and for artificers' work in wood, to work at all works.
6: And I have appointed him and Eliab the [son] of Achisamach of the tribe of Dan, and to every one understanding in heart I have given understanding; and they shall make all things as many as I have appointed thee, —
7: the tabernacle of witness, and the ark of the covenant, and the propitiatory that is upon it, and the furniture of the tabernacle,
8: and the altars, and the table and all its furniture,
9: and the pure candlestick and all its furniture, and the laver and its base,
10: and Aaron's robes of ministry, and the robes of his sons to minister to me as priests,
11: and the anointing oil and the compound incense of the sanctuary; according to all that I have commanded thee shall they make them.
12: ¶ And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
13: Do thou also charge the children of Israel, saying, Take heed and keep my sabbaths; [for] they are a sign with me and among you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am the Lord that sanctifies you.
14: And ye shall keep the sabbaths, because this is holy to the Lord for you; he that profanes it shall surely be put to death: every one who shall do a work on it, that soul shall be destroyed from the midst of his people.
15: Six days thou shalt do works, but the seventh day is the sabbath, a holy rest to the Lord; every one who shall do a work on the seventh day shall be put to death.
16: And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbaths, to observe them throughout their generations.
17: It is a perpetual covenant with me and the children of Israel, it is a perpetual sign with me; for in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth, and on the seventh day he ceased, and rested.
18: And he gave to Moses when he left off speaking to him in mount Sina the two tables of testimony, tables of stone written [upon] with the finger of God.
